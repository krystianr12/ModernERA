        <h3>Mike's Project</h3><br>
        <p>When we met Mike he had a very successful business but didn't quite have a brand. He wanted to grow but he knew he needed help. Within a few weeks Mike was showing off his knew brand that emcompassed all his values, goals, and vision. </p>
        <p>The first step for this project was creating a Logo. A logo that assured his audience he was for real, one that embodied not only his work ethic but his commitment. He wanted something Professional and Empowering and that's what he got!</p><br>
