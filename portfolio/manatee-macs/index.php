        <h3>Logo and Brochure Project</h3><br>
        <p>Growing up in Micanopy I never imagined that I would one day create a logo that would represent an elementary school, but this past summer I got a call from Principal Maynard of the Micanopy Macs Elementary School and she wanted me to design her school logo.  </p>
        <p>When creating any design one must recognize every aspect of it's creation. A logo for example must embody the values that one represents and yet be simple enough that anyone could recognize it. We must look at factors like the target audience "Who needs to see this logo," the competitors "Why me instead of them," and ofcourse we can't forget it's potential. The ability for the logo to grow within it's market without any negative factors.</p><br>
