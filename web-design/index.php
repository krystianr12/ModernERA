          <p>Today's technology is evolving at a rate faster than most of us can keep up with. Most of us have phones that are only a year old but are already experiencing the pressures of buying the newest and latest version. Simply put, if you want to compete with your competitors you must have a strong online presence. <br>
            <br>A website is a great online platform because of its mobility and power. You can literally compile all of your values, goals, services, reviews, and information about your business into one single location. It&rsquo;s not only an amazing organizational tool but it will also help your business grow exponentially.Â  <strong><br>

          <h4>Quality Content</h4>
          <p>Content writing is so crucial for your website digital strategy it&rsquo;s what keeps your customers engaged. Without quality and effective content, customers will lose interest but with too much content your readers might become annoyed, so there must be a perfect balance of what is content quality and quantity. <br>
            One of the top-ranking factors for google is TIME (the time spent on a website). Google tracks the traffic that your website attracts but it also tracks how long they stay. If your website is getting traffic but they aren&rsquo;t staying on your site for more than a minute than you lose ranking points. Google doesn&rsquo;t want websites that people are not interested in they want relevant websites that attract viewers. So it&rsquo;s not enough to get traffic you must keep your viewers on your website longer in order to rank higher. <br>
